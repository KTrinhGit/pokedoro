# Pokémon-Themed Pomodoro Timer Web App

## Overview
This is a fun and interactive Pokémon-themed Pomodoro timer web app that combines productivity with a reward system inspired by Generation 1 Pokémon. Users can work through 25-minute sessions, earn random Pokémon after each session, and view their growing Pokémon collection.

---

## Features
- **Pomodoro Timer**: A traditional Pomodoro timer with 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks.
- **Pokémon Rewards**: Users earn a random Pokémon from the Kanto region (Generation 1) after completing a session.
- **Pokémon Collection**: A separate page allows users to view all the Pokémon they’ve collected so far.
- **Graphics and Sounds**: Pokémon-themed visuals and sound effects (e.g., Pokémon cries) for an engaging experience.
- **Progress Tracker**: Displays completed Pomodoro sessions.
- **Data Persistence**: Saves user progress and collections using local storage.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React for component-based architecture)
- **Pokémon Data**: PokéAPI for retrieving Pokémon information (optional)
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for saving user data

---

## How It Works
1. **Timer**: The main page includes a timer that counts down 25 minutes for work and 5 minutes for a break.
2. **Pokémon Reward**: When a 25-minute session is completed, the app randomly selects a Pokémon from the Kanto Pokédex.
3. **Collection**: The Pokémon earned is added to the user's collection, which can be accessed on a separate page.
4. **Data Persistence**: The collection is saved locally, so users don’t lose progress when refreshing the page.
